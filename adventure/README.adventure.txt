This is the classic game of adventure.  Yeah, really.

It needs some debugging, perhaps compiler, perhaps code, who knows.

This code exposed an llvm bug and I added support to catch similar bugs
in thumbulator as a result.

thumbulator does not handle keyboard input just yet.  Trying to debug this code for use on real hardware
and it crashes before it gets to the point where the opening (game) text shows in the output.
